== Magento ===================

This is a simple gem which wraps Magento XMLRPC calls with Ruby classes.
This allows for you to integrate your Magento Shopping Cart into your Rails Application.
This is not fully tested and some functionality is a WIP.

== Usage =====================

Edit config/config.yml and add your magento api username and api key to the file.


== Issues ====================

A patch needs to be applied to XMLRPC for this to work.

Locate the xmlrpc gem on your system.

Edit the parser.rb file

Around line 504

change to this

  def startElement(name, attrs=[])
    @data = nil
    case name
      when "value"
        @value = nil
        when "nil"
        raise "wrong/unknown XML-RPC type 'nil'" unless Config::ENABLE_NIL_PARSER
        @value = :nil 
      when "array"
        @val_stack << @values
        @values = []
      when "struct"
        @names << @name
        @name = []

        @structs << @struct
        @struct = {} 
    end
  end

This allows for nil values to be handled by the parser.
This bug exists due to the Magento api's handling of the responses.
